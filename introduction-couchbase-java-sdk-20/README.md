### Abstract

Java is a major platform used by loads of Couchbase users. While the original
SDK was inherited from the Memcached times, the 2.0 SDK is a lot more document
focused and draws from the learnings we had with Couchbase 1.X series of SDK.
A lot of things have changed, and again with the main focus has been not
sacrificing performance for any reason. The new SDK is build on RxJava, Netty
and Disruptor, and this talk will introduce each, and diving into why those
libraries have been chosen to solve the problems.

### Topics

- Intro to RxJava, Netty and Disruptor
