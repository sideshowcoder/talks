========================================

Duration: 30 min

### Abstract
The world’s great thinkers have been promising us the dream of a connected
fridge for what seems like an eternity. “Big Fridge” refuses to play ball,
however. Taking the task into our own hands, we have created an intelligent
fridge using nothing other than a somewhat-adequate barcode scanner, a Raspberry
Pi, a portable refrigerator and a dose of Couchbase Mobile. In this talk we’ll
show how Couchbase Mobile, a 500 Kb library for Android, iOS, Windows Phone and
the JVM, lets us build an app that syncs to and from our fridge to a shopping
list app on mobile devices. Take that major fridge manufacturers!
