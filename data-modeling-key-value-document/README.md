### Abstract

In modern applications we often have to weigh different modes of data access
against each other, we need to optimize for a "hot" path while keeping our data
ready for future evolving.
Let me introduce you to different possible patterns for data modeling seen in
the wild and when to use them. Going from Key Value patterns optimized for raw
speed to document style access. Also comparing couchbase to other database to
illustrate the trade offs.

### Topics

- Different building blocks for the data model
- Key Value access patterns, like series keys, referential keys
- Document access patterns, secondary indexes, statistics
- When to use KV vs Document style access
- Comparison to other KV and Document Databases (Riak, MongoDB)
