### Abstract
Couchbase is a NoSQL document store with lightning fast access times, node.js is
a web development platform built for creating blinding fast web applications
using JavaScript; they both natively speak JSON. In this introduction, youâ€™ll
learn how to build fast and scalable web applications leveraging the power of
JSON inherent to node.js and Couchbase.
I will show in this talk how node.js and Couchbase are a match made in heaven
for creating web services built on JSON APIs. Couchbase Server and the Couchbase
Node.js SDK can help you build these APIs without the complexity and impedance
mismatch of translating between the relational database and JavaScript objects.
When it comes to an interactive application, getting data on the user's screen
fast can never be an afterthought so Philipp will focus on showing how the
asynchronous, event driven programming model of node.js works with Couchbase to
provide this near real-time update experience.
