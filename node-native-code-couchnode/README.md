### Abstract

Over the last years node.js has evolved to be a great language to build web
applications. The reason for this is not only that it is based on JavaScript
which already is established around "the web" but also that it provides
excellent facilities for extensions, not only via JavaScript but also
integration of native C libraries.
Couchbase makes a lot of use of this fact making the Couchbase node.js SDK
(Couchnode) a wrapper around the C library providing a node.js like API, but
leveraging the power of a native C library underneat.
So how is this done? How does such a package look like? Let me show you how
integration of C in node.js works and how to "read" a package like Couchnode.
